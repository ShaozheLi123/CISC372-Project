# CISC372-Project

* Introduction:
This project is showing parallel programming. We will compare the code running on CPU, GPU, and multiple cores. On the other hand, we will compare the differences between OpenMP and OpenACC. 
    * The link of the Powerpoint: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PuQJnJfgXkL-lIw235oS85KqpqYZKSHTcXZt8Dwm988/edit#slide=id.p

* Requirements: No special requirements

* Installation: You should install the "timer.h" to help you make sure the time on openacc part, it is not in the library, but you can install in our code folder.

* Configuration: I used the Bridges2 system to run it. You can use the system which you liked.
